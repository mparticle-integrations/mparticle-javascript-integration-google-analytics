Google Analytics Javascript integration for mParticle

⚠️⚠️⚠️

<b>Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) Sunset Notice<br></b>
On 7/1/2023, Google will sunset its Universal Analytics product which means all standard Universal Analytics properties will stop processing new hits starting that day.  If you have a Google Analytics 360 property, your data will stop processing new hits on 10/1/2023.  See [Google's official notice](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en) about their plans to sunset Universal Analytics for all details.

Google recommends moving from UA to Google Analytics 4 (GA4).  Fortunately, mParticle makes this transition easy for you.  Please see our [GA4 documentation here](https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/google-analytics-4/event/) for full set up instructions.  Additionally, Google has [migration documentation here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10759417) which may help in your migration to GA4.

If you are new to Google Analytics, we recommend you start with GA4 per the instructions above.
